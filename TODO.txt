* Delete the automatic_foreign_key and redhillonrails_core subdirectories.

* Schema dumper should use :references on columns rather than
  t.foreign_key, to avoid double definition when loading schema with
  fk.auto_create enabled.
  * Add a spec test for schema dumping/loading round-trip?

* Merge in foreign_key_assocation from its subdirectory.
  * Create configuration to enable/disable it.
  * Create spec tests for it.

* Merge in schema_valiations from latest version on github.
  * Create configuration to enable/disable it.

Clean up README.rdoc


* General cleanups -- get rid of methods no longer used, "features" we no
  longer desire, etc.

  * The spec tests were jammed together inelegantly to deal with the fact that they used different schemas.  That could be made cleaner.
  * Should we get rid of t.belongs_to?
